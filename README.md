# AUTO-INTENSITY-CONTROL-OF-STREET-LIGHTS-USING-ARDUINO
This work is focused on the design and construction of auto intensity  control of street lights. It is based on the sunlight conditions. The main  advantage of street lights is that they increase safety and prevents  accidents and collisions. Normally, street lights are turned on in the  evening and continues to glow till the morning This might result in  unnecessary usage of power as the light continues to glow at full  intensity all the time. But, this project allows us to control the intensity  based on the ambient lighting conditions. In the LDR mode, the lights  have an intensity control based on the ambient light near the LDR.  Light dependent resistors are simple and low-cost devices. These  devices are used where there is a need to sense the presence and  absence of light is necessary. These resistors are used as light  sensors. With slight modifications and enhancements, this project is  applicable for real time usage. In few countries, load shedding is a big  issue due to short fall in electricity and less in resources to generate  electricity. In these countries, load shedding issues can be resolved to  some extent by saving electricity.
